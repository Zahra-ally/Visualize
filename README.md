# Visualize
In order to combat the effects of the pandemic on businesses and take advantage of the uprising of AR technology in the consumers life, I wanted to propose a novel approach to the application and purchasing of make-up products. My approach involved the application of realistic make up over varying skin tones with the use of AR technology. This method will allow users to virtually try the product on before making the purchasing and close the gap between the online and offline realms. Furthermore, it will allow a user to safely and sanitarily try on the make-up product. My web application intends to advance the cosmetic industry with the use of AR technology and bridge the gap between online and offline in the retail world.

## Key Points

## Demonstration
This application is developed by using [Tensorflow/face-landmarks-detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/face-landmarks-detection).

With the facial landmarks i was able to detect a users lip point and overlay the AR objects
